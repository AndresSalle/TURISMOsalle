      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Founded by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada in 1538,
        Bogotá was originally called Santa Fe. The city became the capital of
        the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Granada and later the capital
        of independent Colombia in 1819. Today, the historic downtown preserves
        the rich colonial heritage through its architecture, museums, and
        cultural sites, making it one of South America's most important
        historical centers.
